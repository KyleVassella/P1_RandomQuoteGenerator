This is a random quote generator created using vanilla JavaScript. A series of six quotes are randomly selected from an array, with each quote being displayed only once until the entire array has been cycled through. With each click of the button, the background also changes to a random color. Once the application has been started by clicking the 'Show Quote' button, the app will automatically cycle to the next quote every fifteen seconds if the user does not press the button.
